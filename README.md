========

A basic iOS app that works with the SAP Mobility Platform 3 to retrieve data using OData protocols.

##SAP Mobility Platform
Your SAP Mobility Platform server will be need to be version 3 or higher and for ease of download the .a libraries required to run this app are not included. Please obtain these libraries from your SMP3 installation.

The server is configured for this example to use the OData.org sample OData services for Northwind at http://services.odata.org/Northwind/Northwind.svc/

##How-To Blog
The code is well commented for anybody fairly used to iOS however a blog will be poseted shortly which will detail a step-by-step guide and will be updated here when available.
